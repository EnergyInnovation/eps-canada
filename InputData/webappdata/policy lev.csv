In 2021, Canada had 12,327 gas stations with an average of 8 fuel pumps each, or about 260 pumps per 100k pop.

Transportation,Hydrogen Vehicle Sales Standard,Minimum Required Hydrogen Vehicle Sales Percentage,freight,motorbikes,Freight,Light-Medium Heavy Duty Trucks,604,Yes,Hydrogen Veh Sales Standard,trans hydrogen vehicle minimum,0%,100%,1%,% of new vehicles sold,"**Description:** This policy requires the specified percentage of newly sold vehicles of the selected type(s) to consist of hydrogen vehicles.  If that percentage would already be achieved through BAU sales plus the effects of other policies, this policy has no effect.  Manufactures may meet a sales standard through techniques such as more heavily marketing hydrogen vehicles, lowering the price of hydrogen vehicles, or raising the price of non-hydrogen vehicles. // **Guidance for setting values:** // **Road Vehicles:** No Canadian province has a hydrogen vehicle sales mandate (though hydrogen vehicles are included as a compliance option under zero-emissions vehicle mandates). As of 2021,  Vancouver, Victoria, and Québec City are the only cities in Canada that have hydrogen fuel stations available.   Japan, potentially the country with the greatest commitment to hydrogen vehicles, aims to have 200,000 hydrogen vehicles on its roads by 2025 (which will comprise roughly 0.3% of Japan's vehicles). // **Commercial passenger and freight flights:** The use of hydrogen as a fuel for aircraft has been studied, and small prototype aircraft have been built and flown.  However, this remains a technology in early stages, and much research and development work would be required to reach commercialization, particularly for large aircraft. // **Passenger and freight rail:** Hydrogen is not commonly used for rail vehicles today, but given trains' ability to carry large fuel tanks, no serious technical barriers exist to more widespread usage.  The first hydrogen-powered train, the Coradia iLint, entered service in 2018 (in Germany), and 14 more hydrogen trains are planned for that line. // **Recreational boats and cargo ships:** Hydrogen is not commonly used for ships today, but given ships' ability to carry large fuel tanks, no serious technical barriers exist to more widespread usage.  A handful of hydrogen-powered ships have entered service since the mid-2000s, including several passenger ferries.  Due to the difficulty of making battery electric, long-haul freight ships, hydrogen is often seen as one of the best options for decarbonizing these types of ships.",,hydrogen-vehicle-mandate.html,

This value is in addition to BAU requirements. // **Guidance for setting values:** Canada's proposed federal Clean Fuel Standard is incorporated into the BAU already and requires liquid fuel (gasoline and diesel) suppliers to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce and sell for use in Canada over time, leading to a decrease of approximately 13% (below 2016 levels) in the carbon intensity of liquid fuels used in Canada by 2030. British Columbia's Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires 5% annual average renewable content in gasoline, and 4% renewable content in diesel. The BC Standard also requires reductions in the average carbon intensity of fuels by 20% by 2030.",transportation-sector-main.html#lcfs,low-carbon-fuel-standard.html,

Note that all DAC technologies, even hydroxide sorbents, have their greatest potential effects after 2050, which cannot be seen in a model run that ends in 2050.

For those measures, see the policy levers in the ""Agriculture, Land Use, and Forestry"" category.) // **Guidance for setting values:** A 100% setting implies large DAC research and development investments starting today, and aggressive deployment.

Control Settings,Use 20-Year GWP Values,BUTYGV Boolean Use Twenty Year GWP Values,,,,,1601,No,,,0,1,1,on/off,"**Description:** Non-CO2 GHGs are converted to CO2 equivalent by comparing their warming power per unit mass to that of CO2.  This ratio is called a gas' Global Warming Potential (GWP).  Since different GHGs have different atmospheric lifetimes, the ratio is not static, so GWP values are defined as the cumulative warming effect over a particular timeframe.  By default, the EPS uses 100-year GWP values, i.e., reflecting the ratio of the warming caused by a non-CO2 GHG to CO2 over a 100-year period after the pollutant is emitted.  This is the most common timeframe used in policymaking and in the literature.  Enabling this control setting switches to 20-year GWP values, the second-most-common timeframe used in the literature.  Except for F-gases, non-CO2 GHGs will appear more important when using 20-year GWP values because they have shorter atmospheric lifetimes than CO2. // Note that F-gases in the model are a mixture of many gases, not a single chemical species.  Input data on F-gases was available in 100-year GWP terms and cannot be converted to 20-year GWP values because of the unknown breakdown of the F-gas mixture.  _Therefore, F-gases are always expressed in 100-year GWP terms, ignoring this lever setting._ ",,,
