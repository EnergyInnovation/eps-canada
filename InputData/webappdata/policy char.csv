It is set in chargers per 100,000 people (cumulative, not per year), additional to chargers in the BAU case. This policy lever does not have an effect on energy use/emissions/deployment. It is meant to account for the costs of additional charging infrastructure.   // **Guidance for setting values:**  As of December 2021, Canada had 15,723 chargers, or just over 40 chargers per 100k pop. In 2021, Canada had 12,327 gas stations with an average of 8 fuel pumps each, or about 260 pumps per 100k pop. Therefore, a lever setting of 220 would cause the 2021 population density of EV chargers to equal that of fuel pumps.",,ev-charger-deployment.html,"Number of EV chargers: https://evadoption.com/ev-charging-stations-statistics/

A 100% setting implies consumers are no more concerned about EV range and charging time than they are about range and fueling time of gasoline vehicles.  It does not imply that range is infinite, nor that charging is instantaneous.  This policy only affects passenger cars and SUVs (most light-duty road vehicles).  // **Guidance for setting values:** Canadian model year 2020 all-electric (not hybrid) vehicles had ranges from 175 to 500 km, and the typical charging time was 0.5-0.75 hours (with a DC Fast charger) or 6-10 hours (with a Level 2 charger).",,reduce-range-anxiety-charging-time.html,Ranges: https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1010-january-1-2018-all-electric-light-vehicle-ranges-can-exceed-those                                              Charging Times: https://www.chargepoint.com/files/Quick_Guide_to_Fast_Charging.pdf,
Transportation,Electric Vehicle Sales Standard,Additional Minimum Required EV Sales Percentage,EV Sales Standard,trans EV minimum,0%,100%,1%,% of new vehicles sold,"**Description:** This policy requires the specified percentage of newly sold vehicles of the selected type(s) to consist of battery electric vehicles. If that percentage would already be achieved through BAU sales plus the effects of other policies, such as an EV subsidy, this policy has no effect. Manufactures may meet a sales standard through techniques such as more heavily marketing electric vehicles, lowering the price of electric vehicles, or raising the price of non-electric vehicles. The following descriptions detail the different vehicle types: // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** most light-duty road vehicles //**Light and Medium Commercial, Heavy Duty Trucks, and Heavy Heavy Duty Trucks:** commercial trucks carrying freight, not passengers // **Buses:** including school, transit, and intercity buses // **Heavy Heavy Duty Trucks:** all other heavy road vehicles (mostly freight trucks) // **Commercial passenger flights:** this is not general aviation // **Commercial freight flights:** this includes all other commercial flights, and is not general aviation // **Passenger rail:** intercity, transit, and commuter rail // **Freight rail:** all other rail // **Recreational boats:** not commercial passenger ferries // **Cargo ships:** commercial ships carrying freight // **Passenger motorbikes:** registered motorcycles //// **Guidance for setting values:** // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** Canada's announced Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate would require that 20% of all new light-duty vehicle sales be ZEV by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% by 2035 (which would be equivalent to a setting of 100% in 2035). // **Light and Medium Commercial and Heavy Duty Trucks:** Today, the share of electric freight trucks is very low, but electrification is particularly promising for certain types of trucks, such as those used to make deliveries within cities, those involved in port operations, garbage trucks, and others with frequent starts and stops. // **Buses:** Federally, Canada has earmarked funding to put 5,000 electric buses on the road by 2025, about one-third of the transit fleet in 2022. Québec has targets for 55% of its bus fleets to be electric by 2030, and beginning in 2025 it will only subsidize purchase of buses that are fully electric. // **Commercial passenger and freight flights:** Electricity is commonly used by drones, and small, manned electric aircraft have been developed.  However, limited payload and range may complicate the electrification potential of large, long-haul aircraft.  Therefore, a low setting of this policy lever may be more realistic than a high setting. // **Passenger rail:** In Canada, most trains are diesel or diesel-electric, with the exception of some public transit lines in major cities.  With sufficient investment, most or all passenger rail could potentially be electrified, but many years may be required to complete the associated infrastructure upgrades. // **Freight rail:** Today, in the Canada, little if any freight rail is electrified.  Electrified rail corridors must have sufficient transformer and other electrical capacity to handle the heavy loads of freight rail.  The required infrastructure investments may be substantial and may take many years to complete. // **Recreational boats:** Although only a small percentage of recreational boats are powered by electricity today, the market for electric recreational boats is growing rapidly and is projected to reach $20 billion / year globally by 2027.  Batteries and electric motors are suitable for the typical travel distances and demand cycles of most small pleasure craft, and in some cases, it is possible to retrofit an existing boat with an electric outboard motor and batteries.  Accordingly, a high setting of this policy lever may be reasonable. // **Cargo ships:** Today, few freight ships rely solely on electricity for energy.  The large loads and long distances traveled by ocean-going vessels (with no opportunity to charge while underway) limit the suitability of electricity for these vessel types.  However, there are freight vessels better-suited to electricity, including tug boats (which benefit from the high torque of electric motors) and offshore support vessels (which carry personnel and goods between offshore platforms and the mainland, and perform other support tasks), as these types of vessels travel predictable distances and may easily return to a dock to charge.  Accordingly, a modest setting of this policy lever may be reasonable. // **Passenger motorbikes:** Though electric motorcycles and scooters are popular in Europe and Asia, where motorbikes are commonly used for urban transportation and commuting, electric motorbikes are not yet a significant presence in Canada, where motorbikes are mostly used for recreation.",transportation-sector-main.html#ev-mandate,ev-mandate.html,"https://autoalliance.org/energy-environment/state-electric-vehicle-mandate/

Transportation,Electric Vehicle Subsidy,Additional EV Subsidy Percentage,EV Subsidy,trans EV subsidy,0%,50%,1%,% of vehicle cost,"**Description:** This policy causes government to pay for the specified percentage of the purchase price of new battery electric passenger cars and SUVs (most light-duty road vehicles).  This is in addition to EV subsidies that exist in the BAU case.  // **Guidance for setting values:** Canada currently offers a federal subsidy for up to $5,000 for qualifying electric vehicles, which is already incorporated in the BAU as an average EV subsidy of 20%.The $5,000 federal subsidy represents about 14% of a 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV or 8% of the MSRP of a Tesla Model 3 in 2022.",transportation-sector-main.html#ev-subsidy,ev-subsidy.html,https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml plus Chevrolet and Tesla websites,
Transportation,Feebate,LDVs Feebate Rate,Feebate,trans LDVs feebate,0%,100%,2%,% of global best practice rate,"**Description:** This policy implements a fee on sales of inefficient cars and SUVs (light-duty road vehicles; LDVs) that is rebated to buyers of efficient LDVs.  The feebate policy is revenue-neutral, as the pivot point (the efficiency level that incurs neither a rebate nor a fee) is set such that the total of all fees equals the total of all rebates. // **Guidance for setting values:** The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The global best practice feebate rate is $2,000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which equates to a $2,000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2,000 fee on the 20 mpg car when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2,000/.01 gpm.)",transportation-sector-main.html#feebate,feebate.html,"Greene et al., 2005, ""Feebates, rebates and gas-guzzler taxes: a study of incentives for increased fuel economy"", Energy Policy, 33(6), 757-775, http://cta.ornl.gov/cta/Publications/Reports/FeebateEnergyPolicy_FINAL.pdf.","John German and Dan Meszler, 2010, ""Best Practices for Feebate Program Design and Implementation"", ICCT, http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCT_feebates_may2010.pdf, Table 2"
Transportation,Fuel Economy Standard,Percentage Additional Improvement of Fuel Economy Std,Vehicle Fuel Economy Standards,trans fuel economy standards,0%,100%,1%,% increase in miles/gal,"**Description:** This policy specifies a percentage improvement in fuel economy (distance traveled on the same quantity of fuel with the same cargo or passenger loading) due to fuel economy standards for newly sold vehicles of the selected type(s) with fossil fuel-burning engines. The following descriptions detail the different vehicle types: // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** most light-duty road vehicles // **Light and Medium Commercial and Heavy Duty Trucks:** commercial trucks carrying freight, not passengers // **Buses:** including school, transit, and intercity buses // **Heavy Heavy Duty Trucks:** all other heavy road vehicles (mostly freight trucks) // **Commercial passenger flights:** this is not general aviation // **Commercial freight flights:** this includes all other commercial flights, and is not general aviation // **Passenger rail:** intercity, transit, and commuter rail // **Freight rail:** all other rail // **Recreational boats:** not commercial passenger ferries // **Cargo ships:** commercial ships carrying freight // **Passenger motorbikes:** registered motorcycles //// **Guidance for setting values:** // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** Combined fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks were 6.8 L/100 km in 2020 and are scheduled to rise to 6.1 L/100 km through 2026, then remain constant.  The National Research Council's estimated future average fuel economy is roughly 3.2 L/100 km for a midrange scenario and 2.5 L/100 km for an optimistic scenario. // **Light and Medium Commercial and Heavy Duty Trucks:** Fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles vary by vehicle characteristics, but proposed standards for vocational vehicles (the category that includes buses) would reduce GHG emissions by 24% for 2027 model year vehicles relative to the 2018 model year, then remain constant.  Extrapolating this trend to 2050 would be an 85% improvement relative to 2018, compared to a 40% improvement relative to 2018 in the BAU case.  This could be represented by a policy lever setting of 45%. // **Heavy Heavy Duty Trucks:** Fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles vary by vehicle characteristics, but proposed standards for combination tractor-trailers (which are responsible for roughly 60% of HDV emissions) would reduce GHG emissions by 25% for 2027 model year trucks relative to the 2018 model year, then remain constant.  Extrapolating this trend to 2050 would be an 96% improvement relative to 2018, compared to a 40% improvement relative to 2018 in the BAU case.  This could be represented by a policy lever setting of 56%. // **Commercial passenger flights:** There are currently no fuel economy standards for aircraft.  In the absence of standards, new passenger aircraft fuel economy is projected to improve roughly 17% from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. // **Commercial freight flights:** Because there are currently no fuel economy standards for aircraft, new freight aircraft fuel economy is projected to improve roughly 50% from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. // **Passenger rail:** There are currently no fuel economy standards for trains.  In the absence of standards, new passenger train fuel economy is not projected to change significantly from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. // **Freight rail:** Because there are currently no fuel economy standards for trains, new freight train fuel economy is projected to improve roughly 23% from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. // **Recreational boats:** There are currently no fuel economy standards for recreational boats.  In the absence of standards, new passenger boat fuel economy is not projected to change significantly from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. // **Cargo ships:** There are currently no fuel economy standards for ships.  In the absence of standards, new freight ship fuel economy is projected to improve roughly 21% from 2018-2050 in the BAU case. However, the ICCT suggests in-use CO2 intensity of freight ships could fall by roughly 50% by 2040, corresponding to a 100% improvement in fuel economy. // **Passenger motorbikes:** There are currently no fuel economy standards for motorbikes.

Transportation,Hydrogen Vehicle Sales Standard,Minimum Required Hydrogen Vehicle Sales Percentage,Hydrogen Veh Sales Standard,trans hydrogen vehicle minimum,0%,100%,1%,% of new vehicles sold,"**Description:** This policy requires the specified percentage of newly sold vehicles of the selected type(s) to consist of hydrogen vehicles.  If that percentage would already be achieved through BAU sales plus the effects of other policies, this policy has no effect.  Manufactures may meet a sales standard through techniques such as more heavily marketing hydrogen vehicles, lowering the price of hydrogen vehicles, or raising the price of non-hydrogen vehicles. // **Guidance for setting values:** // **Road Vehicles:** No Canadian province has a hydrogen vehicle sales mandate (though hydrogen vehicles are included as a compliance option under zero-emissions vehicle mandates). As of 2021,  Vancouver, Victoria, and Québec City are the only cities in Canada that have hydrogen fuel stations available.   Japan, potentially the country with the greatest commitment to hydrogen vehicles, aims to have 200,000 hydrogen vehicles on its roads by 2025 (which will comprise roughly 0.3% of Japan's vehicles). // **Commercial passenger and freight flights:** The use of hydrogen as a fuel for aircraft has been studied, and small prototype aircraft have been built and flown.  However, this remains a technology in early stages, and much research and development work would be required to reach commercialization, particularly for large aircraft. // **Passenger and freight rail:** Hydrogen is not commonly used for rail vehicles today, but given trains' ability to carry large fuel tanks, no serious technical barriers exist to more widespread usage.  The first hydrogen-powered train, the Coradia iLint, entered service in 2018 (in Germany), and 14 more hydrogen trains are planned for that line. // **Recreational boats and cargo ships:** Hydrogen is not commonly used for ships today, but given ships' ability to carry large fuel tanks, no serious technical barriers exist to more widespread usage.  A handful of hydrogen-powered ships have entered service since the mid-2000s, including several passenger ferries.  Due to the difficulty of making battery electric, long-haul freight ships, hydrogen is often seen as one of the best options for decarbonizing these types of ships.",,hydrogen-vehicle-mandate.html,https://wamu.org/story/19/03/18/japan-is-betting-big-on-the-future-of-hydrogen-cars/,

Transportation,Mode Shifting,Percent of Travel Demand Shifted to Other Modes or Eliminated,Mode Shifting,trans mode shifting,0%,26%,1%,% of trips shifted,"**Description:** This policy represents a set of measures aimed at reducing demand for passenger or freight transportation in the selected vehicle type(s).  **Passenger car and SUV** trips may be shifted to other travel modes, such as buses, rail, walking, biking, or eliminated through technology such as video conferencing.  Example measures include improved public transit systems, more walking and bike paths, zoning for higher density along transit corridors, zoning for mixed-use developments, roadway and congestion pricing, and increased parking fees.  **Commercial passenger and freight flight** trips may be shifted to inter-city rail or eliminated using technology such as video conferencing.  **Heavy Duty Truck** trips can be reduced through improved logistics that avoids backhauls and transporting empty shipping containers. The following descriptions detail the different vehicle types: // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** most light-duty road vehicles // **Light-Medium Duty Trucks:** would include all light duty vehicles used for freight as well as medium duty trucks such as box trucks. // **Heavy Duty Trucks:** all other heavy road vehicles (mostly freight trucks) // **Commercial passenger flights:** this is not general aviation //// **Guidance for setting values:** // **Passenger cars and SUVs:** The International Energy Agency's BLUE Shifts scenario (from the 2009 report ""Transport, Energy, and CO2: Moving Toward Sustainability"") includes a 26% reduction in usage of cars and SUVs in OECD countries by 2050 relative to a BAU case. // **Commercial passenger flights:** The International Energy Agency's BLUE Shifts scenario (from the 2009 report ""Transport, Energy, and CO2: Moving Toward Sustainability"") includes a 30% reduction in usage of aircraft in OECD countries by 2050 relative to a BAU case. // **Heavy Duty Trucks:** The USA EPS model uses the Federal Highway Administration that approximately 25% of mileage for trucks larger than pickups/minivans/other light vans are for empty backhauls and empty shipping containers.

This policy increases these plants' target capacity factors, but it does not force them to be dispatched if it would be uneconomical to do so. // **Guidance for setting values:** // **Preexisting Natural Gas Nonpeaker:** In the absence of better Canadaian data, the USA EPS Model has preexisting natural gas nonpeakers with an average capacity factor of 48%; however, as part of the proposed Clean Power Plan, the EPA assumed that nonpeaking natural gas plants could reach a 75% capacity factor (ramping up to that value over a number of years).  This would represent a 49% reduction in downtime.  // **New Wind:** Availability of wind cannot be changed by policy, so the main method of increasing capacity factor is technological improvement of wind turbines.  In the absence of better Canadaian data, the USA EPS model uses the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that ""near-future"" wind technology could increase capacity factors by about 10 percentage points. The average capacity factor of new turbines in the BAU case is roughly 47%, so an improvement to 57% might be represented as an 19% setting of this policy lever. // **New Solar PV:** Availability of sunlight cannot be changed by policy, so the main method of improvement is increasing the efficiency of solar cells.

//**This is simplified version of the carbon price. Read below** 
//**Description:** This policy applies a price on fuels used in the selected sector(s) based on their greenhouse gas emissions.  It also increases the base cost of capital equipment (e.g., vehicles, power plants, building components) according to their embedded carbon content. When applied to the Industry Sector, the tax **is** levied on greenhouse gas emissions from non-energy industrial and agricultural processes by default, but these emissions sources can be exempted from the tax by enabling the policy lever ""Exempt Process Emissions from C Tax."" 
//This policy lever applies the full carbon price to **all fuels from the selected sector**. The user must account for any free allocation of credits when applying to the industrial sector.  This price does **not** represent the output-based-pricing system (OBPS), nor cap and trade as it is implemented in specific Canadian provinces. 
// **Guidance for setting values:**  
//Because Canadas carbon pricing system is not uniformly applied all sectors and provinces equally, **this policy will add an additional carbon price** to what was included in the BAU scenario. The BAU Scenario has the existing carbon pricing applied to two sectors, buildings and transportation.  
//**Buildings and transportation**: Because the BAU include the legislated carbon price for these sectors(e.g. $170/tonne in 2030), the value applied above will be **additional.** For example, setting this policy to have a value of $30/tonne in year 2030 will model a price of $200/tonne (170+30).  
//**For all other sectors**:  The BAU didnt include the full legislated carbon price. The value applied above will be **the full carbon price** to the entire sector selected. Therefore, free allocations will have to be considered. For example, if the price is $100/tonne and free allocation is 80%, then the correct price to assume is $20/tonne.

Control Settings,Use 20-Year GWP Values,BUTYGV Boolean Use Twenty Year GWP Values,,,0,1,1,on/off,"**Description:** Non-CO2 GHGs are converted to CO2 equivalent by comparing their warming power per unit mass to that of CO2.  This ratio is called a gas' Global Warming Potential (GWP).  Since different GHGs have different atmospheric lifetimes, the ratio is not static, so GWP values are defined as the cumulative warming effect over a particular timeframe.  By default, the EPS uses 100-year GWP values, i.e., reflecting the ratio of the warming caused by a non-CO2 GHG to CO2 over a 100-year period after the pollutant is emitted.  This is the most common timeframe used in policymaking and in the literature.  Enabling this control setting switches to 20-year GWP values, the second-most-common timeframe used in the literature.  Except for F-gases, non-CO2 GHGs will appear more important when using 20-year GWP values because they have shorter atmospheric lifetimes than CO2. // Note that F-gases in the model are a mixture of many gases, not a single chemical species.  Input data on F-gases was available in 100-year GWP terms and cannot be converted to 20-year GWP values because of the unknown breakdown of the F-gas mixture.  _Therefore, F-gases are always expressed in 100-year GWP terms, ignoring this lever setting._ ",,,,
